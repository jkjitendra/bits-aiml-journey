Area	        Feature	  Integer	Gives the number of pixels within the boundaries of the raisin.		                                                        no
MajorAxisLength	Feature	  Continuous	It measures the environment by calculating the distance between the boundaries of the raisin and the pixels around it.		no
MinorAxisLength	Feature	  Continuous	Gives the length of the main axis, which is the longest line that can be drawn on the raisin.		                        no
Eccentricity	Feature	  Continuous	Gives the length of the small axis, which is the shortest line that can be drawn on the raisin.		                        no
ConvexArea	Feature	  Integer	It gives a measure of the eccentricity of the ellipse, which has the same moments as raisins.		                        no
Extent	        Feature	  Continuous	Gives the number of pixels of the smallest convex shell of the region formed by the raisin.		                        no
Perimeter	Feature	  Continuous	Gives the ratio of the region formed by the raisin to the total pixels in the bounding box.		                        no
Class           Target	  Categorical   Kecimen and Besni raisin.		                                                                                        no
